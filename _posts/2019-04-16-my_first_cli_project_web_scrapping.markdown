For my first CLI project , I did web scrapping. At first it sounded something really difficult thing to do but When i was actually easy to do . 

basically we have to save the html, scrap over the file and find the data that we need through iteration , save it and the show the scrapped data in your desired format. 

I decided to scrap the website which i visit very often. i love to listen to bollywood music, so I choose www.ganaa.com. here the format of showing data is album name, album cover, and the name of the music director or artist's name. Once you click on one of the album it will direct you to another web page and there is a list of the songs and associated artist of the songs. 
So, I wrote a program to list all the albums from New Release row. and list out the name of the songs and artist after selecting a particular album.
